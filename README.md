# Project Origin
In the course I'm studying, Computer Engineering, in the third year, in the second semester, you have to do a final course work, which in turn represents 20 ECTS (that's a lot).
So I was given a list where I could choose the project I wanted to do, and this particular one really caught my eye, because it tackles a real problem, which is the recruitment process.

Problems in the company recruitment process:
-> Long waiting times for a response.
-> Difficult to find.
-> Sometimes even a big waste of time.
-> Accessibility.
-> Waste of talent.

So I applied myself to this job to show that I can combat a real problem, that I can do a project that can shape my professional career and also make a difference.
After a long wait, Professor Rui Ribeiro accepted my proposal and awarded me the job.
